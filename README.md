# Image-Encryption-Image-Recognition-University-Project
A Procedural Programming project during my first year of university.

Here is all the source code I wrote for the Procedural Programming project in my first year of university. 

The project consisted of two parts:
  (1) code and decode a given BMP image using a given secret key
  (2) recognise specific patterns in a bigger image
