# Image-Encryption-Image-Recognition-University-Project
A Procedural Programming project during my first year of university.
All the code is written in C.

The project consisted of two parts:

  (1) code and decode a given BMP image using a given secret key
     How?
        => the pixels of the initial image are randomly mixed using a permutation generated by Durstenfeld's algorithm
        
        => we apply a series of transformation on the newly created array of pixels, in order to obtain a uniform distribution of colors in our image. These transformations rely on a secret key that has to be specified by the user.
        
        => to decode the encrypted image, all we have to do is to follow the same steps mentioned above in the reversed order.
  
  (2) recognise specific patterns in a bigger image
