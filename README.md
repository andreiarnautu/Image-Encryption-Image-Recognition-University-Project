# Image-Encryption-Image-Recognition-University-Project
A Procedural Programming project during my first year of university.
All the code is written in C.

The project consisted of two parts: asd
  (1) code and decode a given BMP image using a given secret key
  (2) recognise specific patterns in a bigger image
